  abstract = {There is a common belief that wysiwyg technical editors are not suited for editing structured texts and generating documents with a high typographical quality. In this paper, we analyze the reasons behind this belief. We next discuss the program GNU TEXmacs and some of its innovations in relation to the difficulties of structured, wysiwyg, technical text editing.},
