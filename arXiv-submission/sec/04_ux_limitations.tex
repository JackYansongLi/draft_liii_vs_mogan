\section{Limitations of \TeX{} in User Experience Design}
\label{sec:ux}

\TeX{} and its derivative, the \LaTeX{} ecosystem, have long occupied a central position in the field of academic typesetting. However, the overall user experience has failed to evolve in sync with the advancement of computing environments and user expectations. From the continuous bloating of distribution sizes to the performance and interaction barriers imposed by the compilation model, and further to the long-standing engineering defects in language design, the \TeX{} ecosystem falls short in modern writing contexts---particularly regarding "usability," "maintainability," and "adaptability to modern workflows." This section analyzes the limitations of \TeX{}'s user experience design from multiple dimensions, including deployment costs, language structure, and practical user experience.

\subsection{Issues with Distribution Scale and Deployment Models}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{TeX Live ISO Size Trends}
\label{fig:texlive-size}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:texlive-size} illustrates the trend in file size for the most popular TeX Live ISO from 2008 to 2025. The horizontal axis represents the year, and the vertical axis represents file size in GB. Starting at 2.4~GB in 2008, the line shows an overall upward trajectory, reaching 5.9~GB by 2025. Despite minor fluctuations (such as a drop to 1.9~GB in 2010 and a slight dip to 3.2~GB in 2018), the long-term trend demonstrates a nearly twofold increase in size, reflecting the continuous expansion of software packages.

This volumetric growth is primarily driven by TeX Live's role as a comprehensive \LaTeX{} distribution, which constantly integrates new fonts, documentation, multi-language support, and packages to adapt to user needs and technological advancements. For instance, while early versions focused on core functionality, later iterations incorporated extensive PDF support, graphics libraries, and extensions, resulting in volume bloat.

However, this continuous expansion warrants critical reflection. Taking TeX Live as an example, a significant portion of its distribution volume consists of documentation sets and font resources. For beginners or light users requiring only basic typesetting functions, such overhead constitutes a clear redundant burden, consuming installation time, disk space, and maintenance effort. Although the \TeX{} ecosystem emphasizes modularity at the package level, the distribution strategy (as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:texlive-installer}) still prioritizes full installation as the default. Minimalist installation options, while available, are neither highlighted nor widely adopted. Consequently, most users default to the full version, effectively "normalizing" the issues of bloat and resource waste.

While distributions like MikTeX attempt to address this, a more aggressive promotion of lean versions in default configurations by making documentation, examples, and large font sets optional is far more rational in terms of efficiency, resource utilization, and environmental impact, particularly in network- or storage-constrained scenarios.

Figure~\ref{fig:texlive-installer} illustrates the complex installation interface. In contrast, Mogan STEM uses an on-demand plugin loading mechanism, where features are only loaded when needed. This significantly reduces the installation size and startup time.

\subsection{Real-World Performance Dilemma}

The performance of \LaTeX{} compilation degrades significantly with document complexity. Documents with extensive cross-references, bibliographies, or complex mathematical content require multiple passes and can take minutes to compile. This creates a frustrating edit-compile-view cycle that interrupts the writing flow.

\subsection{Intrinsic Weakness: Absence of Engineering Standards}

\LaTeX{} lacks formal engineering standards for package development. While the \texttt{lppl} license provides some guidance, there are no enforced standards for:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Package documentation quality
    \item API stability and versioning
    \item Error handling and reporting
    \item Testing and validation
\end{itemize}

This has led to a fragmented ecosystem where package quality varies widely, and compatibility issues are common \cite{interview2021}.

\label{tab:latex-contradictions}
\begin{tabular}{p{3.5cm}p{5cm}p{4cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Contradiction} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Impact} \\
\midrule
Global Naming vs.\ Modularity & \LaTeX2e\ lacks namespaces; all commands and variables share a global symbol table & High risk of package conflicts; loading order directly affects behavior; system fragility \\
Text Substitution vs.\ Structured Interfaces & Macros are essentially untyped token substitutions, lacking parameter signatures and type systems & Static checking is difficult; function interfaces are uncomposable; parameter passing is error-prone \\
Local State via Grouping vs.\ Compiler Awareness & State management relies on TeX's grouping and rollback mechanism rather than explicit variable scoping & Compilers cannot resolve scope; state leakage and logical errors are difficult to detect \\
Conventional Interfaces vs.\ Automatic Verification & Interface constraints rely on documentation and voluntary compliance, not language-level enforcement & Parameter types/counts cannot be statically verified; errors are only exposed at runtime \\
Compatibility vs.\ Modern Features & To maintain compatibility with \LaTeX2e, implementation of new features is cumbersome & Requires reliance on advanced packages like \texttt{xparse} or complex hacks; high learning and maintenance costs \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{User Experience Barriers from a Practical Perspective}

For users, the \LaTeX{} experience is characterized by:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Steep Learning Curve:} Understanding macro expansion, package interactions, and compilation workflows requires significant investment.
    \item \textbf{Cryptic Error Messages:} Error messages often require deep knowledge of \TeX{} internals to interpret.
    \item \textbf{Fragile Workflows:} Small changes can break the compilation in unexpected ways.
    \item \textbf{Limited Tooling:} Compared to modern IDEs, \LaTeX{} editors offer limited refactoring, navigation, and debugging capabilities.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Contributions and Constraints of \LaTeX3}

\LaTeX3 represents an effort to modernize the \LaTeX{} codebase by introducing a more structured programming layer (\texttt{expl3}). While these improvements address some of the technical debt accumulated over decades, they remain constrained by the need for backward compatibility. The improvements are incremental rather than fundamental, and users must still engage with the legacy macro system for many tasks.

\subsection{Limitations of Modern Collaboration Platforms: A Case Study of Overleaf}

In response to \LaTeX{}'s structural deficiencies regarding collaboration support and usability, the academic community has advanced a series of improvement measures. Among these, online collaboration platforms, exemplified by Overleaf, have significantly streamlined the user experience and reduced the technical barrier to entry \cite{overleaf_docs}.

\subsubsection{Key Improvements by Overleaf}

Overleaf has addressed some of \LaTeX{}'s usability issues by providing:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Real-time collaboration features
    \item Simplified compilation management
    \item Version control integration
    \item Template libraries for common document types
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Constraints of Underlying Architecture}

However, Overleaf cannot overcome the fundamental limitations of \LaTeX{}'s architecture:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Compilation is still batch-oriented and slow
    \item Error messages remain cryptic
    \item Real-time preview requires frequent recompilation
    \item Collaboration is at the text level, not the semantic level
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Impact on Trajectory of Technological Evolution}

By providing a veneer of usability over \LaTeX{}'s fundamental limitations, platforms like Overleaf may have inadvertently slowed the adoption of genuinely superior alternatives. Users who might otherwise seek better solutions are satisfied with incremental improvements to the existing system.
